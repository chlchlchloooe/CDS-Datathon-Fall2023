# NYC Green House Gas Emission
In contemporary urban environments, the ecological impact of buildings has emerged as a critical concern, particularly in densely populated metropolises such as New York City. With buildings contributing to over 70 percent of the city's emissions, municipal authorities have taken decisive steps to address this issue. Mandating larger buildings to publicly disclose their energy and water consumption data reflects a commitment to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the overall ecological footprint of the city.
Therefore, we decided to delve into the intricacies of building energy consumption and to explore strategies that contribute to sustainability. Our project endeavors to harness the wealth of New York City's government data available. And we aspire to provide actionable insights and recommendations that can inform policy decisions, guide urban planning, and empower stakeholders to foster sustainability in New York City by utilizing data analysis and machine learning methods.
